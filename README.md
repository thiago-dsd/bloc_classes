# Flutter Bloc Study

This repository contains files and practical examples for studying the **Bloc** library, widely used in Flutter application development. The goal is to provide a detailed and practical understanding of this library, which simplifies the implementation of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management in Flutter projects.

## About Bloc

The **Bloc** library is a powerful state management solution for Flutter. It helps developers separate business logic from UI, ensuring a more maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase. Bloc achieves this by using **Streams** and **Events** to handle state changes efficiently. 

### Key Features:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps UI and business logic independent.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for handling complex state management scenarios.
- **Testability**: Easily test business logic independently of the UI.
- **Reactive Programming**: Uses Streams to manage asynchronous data flows.

Learn more about the library in the [official Bloc documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev).
